# My Daily Schedule App
This application can store text into hours of the day to assist users with their daily schedules. The hour tasks are color-coded so that the user can see when a task is in the past (it will become non-editable); if it's currently taking plac, or if it's scheduled for a future hour. The user can save these tasks with the little blue button to the right of each hour/task.
